*Py-Hardware-Support* - A collection of python modules for common laboratory hardware
=====================================================================================

Here's a small collection of some python modules that can be used to add hardware support to your programs. I have written those to be easy to use but not necessarily covering all the functionality the library or device has to offer.

   uc480

How to use these modules
========================

In order to use one of these modules in your own scripts, simply copy the respective folder somewhere into your project tree where python is looking for modules and use standard module import. Examples are given for each module.
