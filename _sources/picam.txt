Support for Princeton Instruments' PICam Library - :py:mod:`picam`
==================================================================

Python wrapper around Princeton Instruments' PICam camera SDK using :py:mod:`ctypes`. This version has been partly inspired by Joe Lowney's GitHub project (https://github.com/joelowney/PythonForPicam).

In order to run this module, you have to have the PICam library, provided by Princeton Instruments at ftp://ftp.princetoninstruments.com/Public/Software/Official/PICam, installed on your computer. The module looks for *Picam.dll* either at a path provided by the user or at the path provided in the environment variable *PicamRoot*, which is created by the PICam installer.

.. note:: This version of :py:mod:`picam` was developed under Python 2.7 and does not yet run under Python 3 mainly due to the changed print syntax.
